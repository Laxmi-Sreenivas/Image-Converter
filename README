We all worked on the code together over zoom calls.
Everyones contribution was equal and picking specific areas is not possible.

Image details  :
                        1)The LZW minimum code of the GIF file has to 7.
                        2)The BMP produced may have slight distortion as the end.
                        3)The name of the BMP file produced is "output.BMP".
                        4)The GIF file name has to be less than 36 characters.
                        5)GIF file needs to be in the directory

After running the executable , type the GIF file name and press 'Enter'.

If you get 'segmentation fault' after runnung the code then,
1. The GIF file is not in the directory.
2. The GIF file might not be uncompressed.
(compressed GIF files emit indexes which are not part of root pallete codes and these codes are ignored by code)
